* Rules

+ Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
+ Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
+ Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
+ Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction

* Pseudocode
** Start ...

1) user inputs ~n~
   ~n~ is the size of the grid -> ~n x n~
2) coordinate_name = "x0y0"
3) draw_grid()
4) Adds coordinate and key/value to hashmap
   ~key: "x0y0" | value: ' '~
5) Initial hashmap value is
   x0y0: ' '

** update_coordinate("coordinate_name, counter") -> &str

1) extract_coordinates()
1) return ~updated_coordinate~

** draw_grid("coordinate_name, counter") -> ()

1) Loop
   till counter == n*n
   1) println" " ~n~ number of times
   2) update_coordinate()
   3) move to next line
2) return

** extract_coordinated()

1) take "x13y19"
2) return 13, 19
