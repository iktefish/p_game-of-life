+ Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation
+ Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
+ Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation
+ Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
* Idea
